# EEScenarios
Scenarios for Empty Epsilon.
Scenarios here may be placed on the Empty Epsilon server in the scripts folder and any connecting client can use them without having to download anything. Be sure to get any required files when you get the scenario. For example, the sandbox has several required files in the sandbox folder, Black Wall requires cpu_ship_diversification_scenario_utility.lua among other required files.
